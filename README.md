# Nesaride-UNESA-Inter-Campus-Online-Ojek-Prototype-Python-Based-
This project is a prototype of an online ojek (motorcycle taxi) application designed to facilitate transportation between UNESA Campus A and Campus B. Built using Python, the application allows students to book rides easily, get matched with available drivers, and pay for the service. Instead of fixed fares, the system operates on a tipping model, where students voluntarily provide a tip to the driver as compensation for the ride. Key features include ride booking, driver matching, estimated travel time, and a simple payment interface. This project aims to improve mobility and convenience for the UNESA academic community while fostering a fair and flexible payment system for drivers.
